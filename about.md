Shahana is a 15 year old creative soul who hails from the valleys
of Western Ghats. She's an artist at heart and she wants to pursue
a career in Psychology. She works with various mediums and styles, but her favourites are silouettes and sceneries using crayons and oil pastels. She also loves doing Anime and Manga kind of drawings.

This website is a gift from her brother for her 15th birthday so
that she can showcase her work to the world!
